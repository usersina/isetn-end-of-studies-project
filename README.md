# End of Studies Project (WIP)

This is the end of studies project rapport.

### **TODO:**

- [ ] Include the correct covert page.
- [ ] Fix all occurrences of `\lipsum` with their actual content.
- [ ] Fix the use of tenses; for the introduction use the future tense, for the conclusion use the past tense. Also use present tense in the chapter sections themselves aside from the introduction and the conclusion.
- [x] Fix the ~~dedications and~~ acknowledgements.
- [ ] (If relevant) If too many acronyms are used, add a list for it before the beginning of the general introduction.
- [ ] (If relevant) If too many code blocks many other diagrams are used, create an appendices list with custom numbering at the end of this report.

### Helpers:
